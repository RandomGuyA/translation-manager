<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>The National Park Visitor Centre or &nbsp;€˜Mountain Centre&#39; is located
<br/>7km south west of Brecon and is one of the most popular visitor
<br/>attractions in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The Centre
<br/>stands 1100ft (330m) above sea level and offers stunning views</strong></span><a href="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/visiting_centre_1.png"><img alt="people sittingoutside building" src="/all_images_in_here_please/great_days_out/visit_centre.png" style="width: 172px; margin: 12px; float: right; height: 254px;"/></a><br/>
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>of the highest mountains (Pen y Fan and Corn Du) in South</strong></span><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Wales.</strong></span><br/>
<br/>In the Centre there are interpretation boards, maps and short&nbsp; films which explain the history of the National Park and the Brecon&nbsp; Beacons. The three dimensional relief map of the entire National&nbsp; Park is an extremely popular exhibit and staff are on hand to&nbsp; assist with any enquiries you may have about the National Park.
<br/>
<br/>Throughout the year there are events available such as guided&nbsp; walks and children&#39;s activities, copies of which can be found at the&nbsp; Centre and on the Guided Walks, Children's Activities and Family&nbsp; Events pages on our website www.visitbreconbeacons.com/events. Other&nbsp; facilities include the popular tearooms serving local produce and&nbsp; home cooked food, a gift shop and easy access toilet facilities.&nbsp; Outside, families and children can enjoy the large grassed area in&nbsp; front of the building for picnics or to play games.
<br/>
<br/>The adjacent common land, Mynydd Illtyd, offers plenty of easy walks&nbsp; with fantastic views. Route maps are available in the shop or go to&nbsp; the Wildlife Walks page on the website and follow the link to Mynydd&nbsp; Illtyd for a nature walk. For mountain biking there are two marked&nbsp; routes to choose from; the easy family Visitor Centre Route or the&nbsp; more challenging Mynydd Illtyd route, both of which can be found&nbsp; on our mountain biking pages at www.mtbbreconbeacons.co.uk.
